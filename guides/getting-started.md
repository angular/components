# Getting Started with Angular Material

This guide explains how to set up your Angular project to begin using Angular Material. It includes
information on prerequisites, installing Angular Material, and optionally displaying a sample
Material component in your application to verify your setup.

This guide assumes that the [Angular CLI](https://angular.dev/tools/cli/setup-local#install-the-angular-cli) has already been installed.

## Install Angular Material

Add Angular Material to your application by running the following command:

```bash
ng add @angular/material
```

The `ng add` command will install Angular Material, the
[Component Dev Kit (CDK)](https://material.angular.io/cdk/categories),
[Angular Animations](https://angular.dev/guide/animations) and ask you the following questions to
determine which features to include:

1. Choose a prebuilt theme name, or "custom" for a custom theme:

   You can choose from [prebuilt material design themes](https://material.angular.io/guide/theming#pre-built-themes) or set up an extensible [custom theme](https://material.angular.io/guide/theming#defining-a-theme).

2. Set up global Angular Material typography styles:

   Whether to apply the global [typography](https://material.angular.io/guide/typography) styles to your application.

3. Set up browser animations for Angular Material:

   Importing the [`BrowserAnimationsModule`](https://angular.dev/api/platform-browser/animations/BrowserAnimationsModule) into your application enables Angular's [animation system](https://angular.dev/guide/animations). Declining this will disable most of Angular Material's animations.

The `ng add` command will additionally perform the following actions:

* Add project dependencies to `package.json`
* Add the Roboto font to your `index.html`
* Add the Material Symbols icon font to your `index.html`
* Add a few global CSS styles to:
  * Remove margins from `body`
  * Set `height: 100%` on `html` and `body`
  * Set Roboto as the default application font

You're done! Angular Material is now configured to be used in your application.

### Display a component

Let's display a slide toggle component in your app and verify that everything works.

You need to import the `MatSlideToggleModule` that you want to display by adding the following lines to
your standalone component's imports, or otherwise your component's `NgModule`.

```ts
import { MatSlideToggleModule } from '@angular/material/slide-toggle';

@Component ({
  imports: [
    MatSlideToggleModule,
  ]
})
class AppComponent {}
```

Add the `<mat-slide-toggle>` tag to the `app.component.html` like so:

```html
<mat-slide-toggle>Toggle me!</mat-slide-toggle>
```

Run your local dev server:

```bash
ng serve
```

Then point your browser to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

You should see the Material slide toggle component on the page.

In addition to the installation schematic, Angular Material comes with
[several other schematics](https://material.angular.io/guide/schematics) (like nav, table,
address-form, etc.) that can be used to easily generate pre-built components in your application.
