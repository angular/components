CDK stepper provides a foundation upon which more concrete stepper varieties can be built. A
stepper is a wizard-like workflow that divides content into logical steps

### Behavior captured by CdkStepper
The base CDK version of the stepper primarily manages which step is active. This includes handling
keyboard interactions and exposing an API for advancing or rewinding through the workflow.

#### Linear stepper
A stepper marked as `linear` requires the user to complete previous steps before proceeding.
For each step, the `stepControl` attribute can be set to the top level `AbstractControl` that
is used to check the validity of the step.

There are two possible approaches. One is using a single form for stepper, and the other is
using a different form for each step.

Alternatively, if you don't want to use the Angular forms, you can pass in the `completed` property
to each of the steps which won't allow the user to continue until it becomes `true`. Note that if
both `completed` and `stepControl` are set, the `stepControl` will take precedence.

#### Using a single form for the entire stepper
When using a single form for the stepper, any intermediate next/previous buttons within the steps
must be set to `type="button"` in order to prevent submission of the form before all steps are
complete.

#### Using a form for each individual step
When using a form for each step, the workflow is advanced whenever one of the forms is submitted.

### Types of steps

#### Optional step
If completion of a step in linear stepper is not required, then the `optional` attribute can be set
on `CdkStep` in a `linear` stepper.

#### Editable step
By default, steps are editable, which means users can return to previously completed steps and
edit their responses. `editable="false"` can be set on `CdkStep` to change the default.

#### Completed step
By default, the `completed` attribute of a step returns `true` if the step is valid (in case of
linear stepper) and the user has interacted with the step. The user, however, can also override
this default `completed` behavior by setting the `completed` attribute as needed.

### Stepper buttons
There are two button directives to support navigation between different steps:
`CdkStepperNext` and `CdkStepperPrevious`. When placed inside a step, these will automatically
add click handlers to advance or rewind the workflow, respectively.

### Resetting a stepper
If you want to reset a stepper to its initial state, you can use the `reset` method. Note that
resetting it will call `reset` on the underlying form control which clears the value.

### Keyboard interaction
| Keyboard shortcut      | Action                          |
|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd>  | Focus the previous step header. |
| <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> | Focus the next step header.     |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd>       | Select the focused step.        |
| <kbd>Space</kbd>       | Select the focused step.        |

### Accessibility
Apart from the built-in keyboard support, the stepper doesn't apply any treatment. When implementing
your own component, it is recommended that the stepper is treated as a grouped view for accessibility
purposes by giving it a `role="group"`. The header of step that can be clicked to select the step
should be given `role="button"`, and the content that can be expanded upon selection should be given
`role="region"`. Furthermore, the step header should have an `aria-expanded` attribute that
reflects its expanded state.

You can refer to the [Angular Material stepper](https://github.com/angular/components/tree/main/src/material/stepper) as an example of an accessible implementation.
