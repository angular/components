 * Line mapping utilities which can be used to retrieve line and character based

 * to TypeScript's "ts.getLineAndCharacterFromPosition" utility, but we cannot leverage
 * their logic for line mappings as it's internal and we need to generate line mappings
 * for non-TypeScript files such as HTML templates or stylesheets.
 *
 * Line and character can be retrieved by splitting a given source text based on
 * line breaks into line start entries. Later when a specific position is requested,
 * the closest line-start position is determined based on the given position.
