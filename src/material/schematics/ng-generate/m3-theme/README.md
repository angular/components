# Material 3 Custom Theme schematic

```shell
ng generate @angular/material:m3-theme
```

This schematic allows users to create new Material 3 theme configurations based
on custom colors by using [Material Color Utilities](https://github.com/material-foundation/material-color-utilities).

The generated [color palettes](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/roles) are
optimized to have enough contrast to be more accessible. See [Science of Color Design](https://material.io/blog/science-of-color-design) for more information about Material's color design.

For more customization, custom palette colors can be also be provided for the
secondary, tertiary, and neutral colors. It is recommended to choose colors that
are contrastful, Material has more detailed guidance for [accessible design](https://m3.material.io/foundations/accessible-design/patterns).

The output of the schematic will create a file named `m3-theme.scss` at the
specified directory or the project root with the generated themes. The exported
themes (`$light-theme` and/or `$dark-theme`) can be provided to component theme
mixins.

If you're using the system variables option, you should remember to either provide values for the
system variables (all prefixed with `--sys-`), or to include the `system-level-colors` and
`system-level-typography` mixins which will generate the values based on your theme.

The default prefix for system variables is `--sys-`. This prefix can be customized. For
example, to change the prefix to `--md-sys-`, use the following configuration at the color or typography level:
`system-prefix: md-sys`.

```scss
@use '@angular/material' as mat;
@use './path/to/my-theme';

@include mat.core();

html {
  // Apply the light theme by default
  @include mat.core-theme(my-theme.$light-theme);
  @include mat.button-theme(my-theme.$light-theme);

  // When using system variables, remember to provide values for them
  // or uncomment the lines below to generate them from the theme.
  // @include mat.system-level-colors(my-theme.$light-theme);
  // @include mat.system-level-typography(my-theme.$light-theme);
}
```

## Options

### Required

* `primaryColor` - Color to use for app's primary color palette (Note: the other
palettes described in the Material 3 spec will be automatically chosen based on
your primary palette unless specified, to ensure a harmonious color combination).

### Optional

* `secondaryColor` - Color to use for app's secondary color palette. Defaults to
secondary color generated from Material based on the primary.
* `tertiaryColor` - Color to use for app's tertiary color palette. Defaults to
tertiary color generated from Material based on the primary.
* `neutralColor` - Color to use for app's neutral color palette. Defaults to
neutral color generated from Material based on the primary.
* `directory` - Relative path to a directory within the project that the
generated theme file should be created in. Defaults to the project root.
* `themeTypes` - Theme types ('light', 'dark', or 'both') to generate themes for. Defaults to both.
* `useSystemVariables` - Whether to generate a theme that uses system-level variables for easier
dynamic theming. Defaults to false.
