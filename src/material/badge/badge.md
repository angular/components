Badges are small status descriptors for UI elements. A badge consists of a small circle,
typically containing a number or other short set of characters, that appears in proximity to
another object.

Badges must always be applied to [block-level elements][block-level].

### Badge position
By default, the badge will be placed `above after`. The direction can be changed by defining
the attribute `matBadgePosition` follow by `above|below` and `before|after`.

<!-- example({"example":"badge-overview",
              "file":"badge-overview-example.html",
              "region":"mat-badge-position"}) -->

The overlap of the badge in relation to its inner contents can also be defined
using the `matBadgeOverlap` tag. Typically, you want the badge to overlap an icon and not
a text phrase. By default it will overlap.

<!-- example({"example":"badge-overview",
              "file":"badge-overview-example.html",
              "region":"mat-badge-overlap"}) -->

### Badge sizing
The badge has 3 sizes: `small`, `medium` and `large`. By default, the badge is set to `medium`.

Badges that are `small` do not show the label text. This can be useful in contexts such as showing there are unread notifications but not needing to show the exact amount.

You can change the size by adding `matBadgeSize` to the host element.

<!-- example({"example":"badge-overview",
              "file":"badge-overview-example.html",
              "region":"mat-badge-size"}) -->

### Badge visibility
The badge visibility can be toggled programmatically by defining `matBadgeHidden`.

<!-- example({"example":"badge-overview",
              "file":"badge-overview-example.html",
              "region":"mat-badge-hide"}) -->

### Accessibility
You must provide a meaningful description via `matBadgeDescription`. When attached to an interactive
element, `MatBadge` applies this description to its host via `aria-describedby`. When attached to
a non-interactive element, `MatBadge` appends a visually-hidden, inline description element. The
badge determines interactivity based on whether the host element is focusable.

When applying a badge to a `<mat-icon>`, it is important to know that `<mat-icon>` is
`aria-hidden="true"` by default. If the combination of icon and badge communicates meaningful
information, always surface this information in another way. [See the guidance on indicator
icons for more information](https://material.angular.dev/components/icon/overview#indicator-icons).
