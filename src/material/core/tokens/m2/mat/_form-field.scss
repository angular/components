  // 1. Using container queries to hide the label and change the padding - this doesn't work
  // because size container queries require setting the `container-type` property which breaks
  // the form field layout. We could use style queries, but they're only supported in Chrome.
  // 2. Monitoring the size of the label - we already have a `ResizeObserver` on the label so we
  // could reuse it to also check when it becomes `display: none`. This would allows us to remove
  // the three padding tokens. We don't do it, because it would require us to always set up
  // the resize observer, as opposed to currently where it's only set up for outlined form fields.
  // This may lead to performance regressions.
  // 3. Conditionally adding `::before` and `::after` to the infix with positive and negative
  // margin respectively - this works, but is likely to break a lot of overrides that are targeting
  // a specific padding. It also runs the risk of overflowing the container.
