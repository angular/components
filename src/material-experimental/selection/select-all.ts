 * Makes the element a select-all toggle.

 * Must be used within a parent `MatSelection` directive. It toggles the selection states
 * of all the selection toggles connected with the `MatSelection` directive.
 * If the element implements `ControlValueAccessor`, e.g. `MatCheckbox`, the directive
 * automatically connects it with the select-all state provided by the `MatSelection` directive. If
 * not, use `checked` to get the checked state, `indeterminate` to get the indeterminate state,
 * and `toggle()` to change the selection state.
