## Contributing

Please open bugs against the Angular Material and CDK components, directives, documentation
contents, API docs, and demos in the
[Angular Components repo](https://github.com/angular/components/issues).

Please only open issues with the documentation site itself (not the content) in
[this repo](https://github.com/angular/material.angular.io/issues). This includes issues like the
navigation not working properly, examples or documentation not being presented in an accessible way,
issues with rendering or layout of the documentation pages, etc.
