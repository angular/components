 * Builds and deploys the docs app with snapshot artifacts built
 * from the currently checked-out `angular/components` `HEAD`.
 *
 * This allows us to build the library artifacts and docs-content
 * directly without needing to wait for e.g. NPM to finish.
 *
 * One downside is that the docs site might be ahead of what is available
 * on NPM, potentially causing examples to not work in StackBlitz. These should
 * never break though since the stable release train is supposed to never receive
 * breaking changes (i.e. `material.angular.dev` Stackblitz should work as expected).
 *
 * Building based on the NPM packages would result in some inevitable complexity.
 * For example: we would know that `13.2.0` is our latest release. We would need
 * to wait for the NPM packages to be available (in case CI runs for the bump commit).
 * Since packages will not be available and CI cannot wait for this to happen, the
 * caretaker would need to manually re-run the job. Additionally it would require some
 * additional rather complicated logic to find the proper matching docs-content revision.
