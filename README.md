## About the team
The Angular Components team is part of the Angular team at Google. The team includes both Google
employees and community contributors from around the globe.

Our team has two primary goals:
* Build high-quality UI components that developers can drop into existing applications
* Provide tools that help developers build their own custom components with common interaction
patterns


What do we mean by "high-quality" components?
* Internationalized and accessible so that all users can use them.
* Straightforward APIs that don't confuse developers.
* Behave as expected across a wide variety of use-cases without bugs.
* Behavior is well-tested with both unit and integration tests.
* Customizable within the bounds of the Material Design specification.
* Performance cost is minimized.
* Code is clean and well-documented to serve as an example for Angular developers.

## Browser and screen reader support
The Angular Components team supports the most recent two versions of all major browsers:
Chrome (including Android), Firefox, Safari (including iOS), and  Edge.

We aim for great user experience with the following screen readers:
* **Windows**: NVDA and JAWS with FF / Chrome.
* **macOS**: VoiceOver with Safari / Chrome.
* **iOS**: VoiceOver with Safari
* **Android**: Android Accessibility Suite (formerly TalkBack) with Chrome.
* **Chrome OS**: ChromeVox with Chrome.
