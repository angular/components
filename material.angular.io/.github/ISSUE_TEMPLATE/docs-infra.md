Use the Angular Components repository (https://github.com/angular/components/issues/new/choose)
to report issues.

The Angular team can't provide general troubleshooting help. This is especially true when the
problem is specific to your app and cannot be reproduced in a StackBlitz demo. 
However, the extended community of users may be able to provide help via the following channels: 
- StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/angular-material2
- Gitter: https://gitter.im/angular/material2
- Google Groups: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/angular-material2
