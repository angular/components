# Developer guide: getting your environment set up
1. Make sure you have both `node` and `yarn` installed.
   We recommend using `nvm` to manage your node versions.
2. angular/components uses Bazel which requires certain Bash and UNIX tools.
   - On Windows: Follow the [instructions](https://bazel.build/install/windows#installing-compilers-and-language-runtimes)
   to install [`MSYS2`](https://www.msys2.org/) and the listed "Common MSYS2 packages".
   Afterwards create an environment variable `BAZEL_SH` and its value to be `C:\msys64\usr\bin\bash.exe`.
   Alternatively, you can also use [Chocolately](https://bazel.build/install/windows#chocolately) which will install latest available version of Bazel and its dependencies.
   - On Ubuntu: Make sure `gcc` is installed, you can check if `gcc` is installed on your machine by running `which gcc`, if the command returns a path then the compiler is installed, otherwise can be installed with `sudo apt-get install build-essential`.
3. Fork the `angular/components` repo on GitHub.
4. Clone your fork to your machine with `git clone`.
   Recommendation: name your git remotes `upstream` for `angular/components`
   and `<your-username>` for your fork. Also see the [team git shortcuts](https://github.com/angular/components/wiki/Team-git----bash-shortcuts).
5. From the root of the project, run `yarn` to install the dependencies.


To build angular/components in release mode, run `yarn build`. The output can be found under `dist/releases`.

To bring up a local server, run `yarn dev-app`. This will automatically watch for changes
and rebuild. The browser should refresh automatically when changes are made.

### Running tests
To run unit tests, run `yarn test <target>`. The `target` can be either a short name (e.g. `yarn test button`) or an explicit path `yarn test src/cdk/stepper`.
To run the e2e tests, run `yarn e2e`.
To run lint, run `yarn lint`.

You can debug unit tests by running `yarn test` with the `--debug` option. This will allow you to
manually connect a browser to the Karma server.

### Getting Packages from Build Artifacts
Each CI run for a Pull Request stores the built Angular packages as
[build artifacts](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/artifacts). The artifacts are not guaranteed to be
available as a long-term distribution mechanism, but they are guaranteed to be available around the
time of the build.

You can access the artifacts for a specific CI run by going to the workflow page, clicking on the
`upload_release_packages` job and then switching to the "Artifacts" tab.

#### Archives for each Package
On the "Artifacts" tab, there is a list of links to compressed archives for Angular packages. The
archive names are of the format `<package-name>-pr<pr-number>-<sha>.tgz` (for example
`material-pr12345-a1b2c3d.tgz`).

One can use the URL to the `.tgz` file for each package to install them as dependencies in a
project they need to test the Pull Request changes against. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/add)
supports installing dependencies from URLs to `.tgz` files. As an example, update the dependencies
in `package.json` to point to the artifact URLs and then run `yarn` to install the packages:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "@angular/cdk": "https://<...>.circle-artifacts.com<...>/cdk-pr12345-a1b2c3d.tgz",
  "@angular/material": "https://<...>.circle-artifacts.com<...>/material-pr12345-a1b2c3d.tgz",
}
```

#### Download all Packages
In addition to the individual package archives, a `.tgz` file including all packages is also
available (named `all-pr<pr-number>-<sha>.tgz`). This can be used if one prefers to download all
packages locally and test them by either of the following ways:

1. Update the dependencies in `package.json` to point to the local uncompressed package directories.
2. Directly copy the local uncompressed package directories into the `node_modules/` directory
   of a project.


### Approving public API changes
If you're making changes to a public API, they need to be propagated to our public API golden files.
To save the changes you can run `yarn approve-api <target>` and to review the changes, you can look
at the file under `tools/public_api_guard/<target>.d.ts`.


### Disabling Git hooks
If your development workflow does not intend the commit message validation to run automatically
when commits are being created, or if you do not want to run the formatter upon `git commit`, you
can disable any installed Git hooks by setting `HUSKY=0` in your shell environment. e.g.

```bash
# .zshrc
export HUSKY=0

# .bashrc
export HUSKY=0
```

### Injecting variables into the dev app

A set of environment variables is made available within the dev-app. Such variables
will be injected into the dev-app, so that e.g. API keys can be used for development
without requiring secrets to be committed. 

The following variables are currently used in the dev-app:

* `GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY` - Optional key for the Google Maps API.

For example, you can store a personal development Google Maps API key for the
dev-app within your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file.

```bash
export GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY=<api-key>
```
